It took Weilai Automobile a year to increase its market value from about US$3 billion to nearly US$90 billion, approaching the mobile phone giant Xiaomi Group. Ideal Motors and Xiaopeng Motors have only been listed for half a year, and their market value has soared from less than US$5 billion in Pre-IPO to about US$30 billion. The upper limit of the sharp influx of capital comes from Tesla.",
        "blogDetailDesc2": "In 2020, when the COVID-19 epidemic spread across the world, Tesla still delivered 495,500 units and recorded a full-year profit for the first time. This also pushed Tesla's stock price all the way up, making Musk the world's richest man. The market value of the winners of the first round of car-making wars will increase sharply in 2020, which will undoubtedly attract giants from all walks of life. The upsurge in the industry continues to rise, reaching its peak with Apple's actual actions to build cars. Domestic technology giants are also entering the market. Baidu and Geely have established a joint venture smart car company, and rumors of Xiaomi's car manufacturing have been repeatedly spread. At the same time, under the traction of the wave of new cars, traditional car giants are also scrambling to show their brands. SAIC, Changan, Dongfeng, Great Wall, Geely and even BYD have all established independent high-end smart electric car brands without exception. And the second echelon of new cars that have survived the cold winter of 2019, such as WM Motor, Leap Motor, Hezhong Auto, etc., also use the Sci-Tech Innovation Board as a bargaining chip to obtain capital and fodder in a timely manner and charge towards the sinking market. Even, according to 36 Krypton’s understanding, the second wave of Internet cross-border car-making is also brewing, and the legendary Li Yinan’s car-making project has surfaced. There is no doubt that a new round of 'Hundred Car Wars' will be unveiled in 2021. Tesla has launched a fierce attack on the Chinese market with a goal of 500,000 vehicles. The top camp of new cars will strengthen the moat by improving technology and services this year, and the second echelon of car manufacturing projects will also compete for new cars in 2021. capital channel. The transformation of traditional car companies and the car-making projects that later entered the game must seize this crucial window period. This is a turbulent year, and it is the eve of an EV (Electric Vehicle) melee that lasts for 5 or even 10 years."
